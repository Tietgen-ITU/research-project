# What has been done during this week?

### Created teams channel
A teams channel has been created, and Emil, Pinar, and I are all members. Here we are going to share documents between each other and have a channel of communication.

### Submitted draft of project proposal 
Also our 1st draft of the Project Proposal has been forwarded. Feedback was provided which we have responded upon. Also, Emil created a group in LearnIT and @arnenator has become a member of that group 

### Looking into DuckDB
Andreas has started looking into DuckDB, and how it works. In his search of finding where they write to disk, he looked at the directory `src/storage` where the `buffer_manager.cpp` file is located. In order to get a better understanding of it all, we found a [blog post](https://duckdb.org/2024/07/09/memory-management.html) from DuckDB that talks about what the different "systems" DuckDB handles, and in which situations that they spill to disk.

@arnenator also managed to setup his local environment and compile DuckDB.

## Questions for supervision

# Meeting Notes

We do not yet have access to SSDs with FDP support. Pinar is working on it. 
Emil has watched the videos and looked at that. He has a good understanding of how SSDs works and is looking at the documentation.

# Actions

- We should keep reading
- Keep watching the videos 
- Try and play around and understand duckdb
