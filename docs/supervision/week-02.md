# What has been done during this week?

### Created teams channel
A teams channel has been created, and Emil, Pinar, and I are all members. Here we are going to share documents between each other and have a channel of communication.

### Submitted draft of project proposal 
Also our 1st draft of the Project Proposal has been forwarded. Feedback was provided which we have responded upon. Also, Emil created a group in LearnIT and @arnenator has become a member of that group 

### Looking into DuckDB
Andreas has started looking into DuckDB, and how it works. In his search of finding where they write to disk, he looked at the directory `src/storage` where the `buffer_manager.cpp` file is located. In order to get a better understanding of it all, we found a [blog post](https://duckdb.org/2024/07/09/memory-management.html) that from DuckDB that talks about what the different "systems" in DuckDB handles, and in which situations that they spill to disk.

@arnenator also managed to setup his local environment and compile DuckDB.
