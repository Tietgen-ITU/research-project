# What have we done this week?
Emil and sat down trying to write down the project description. We tried to follow some of the things that were covered in last weeks presentation. However, while doing so, we got a little bit confused. 

- What is the plan with the research project? Are we going to try and implement fdp support? or is it just to make a plan for how to implement FDP support?
- What is our contribution going to be? Again is it that we are going to write an implementation? or is it to do the feasibility study?
- Are we allowed to get paper about the cachelib library, that does something similar to our project?

Also we talked about you were going to travel, and for that reason we could not have supervision meetings the next two weeks. So our next question is the following:

- We are probably going to send you a draft of the project proposal tomorrow. If you approve that what is the next step? Research question?
- When the research question is done? Do we then try and study how `DuckDB` works?
