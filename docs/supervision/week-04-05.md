# What has been done during the last two weeks?

@arnenator has continued reading. There is still a lot left to read, but he is make steady progress. Looking at the video's about SSDs and FDP made a lot of sense in terms of looking at the actual implementation. For that reason @arnenator is currently spending more than half of his time reading and then looking at the implementation of FDP into `CacheLib` created by Meta. All notes describing the implementation can be found in `docs/fdp/cachelib-fdp-impl.md`. It is still ongoing.
