# Meeting Notes

> [!NOTE]
> No meeting took place this week as Pinar had to attend to a conference

Emil reached out to Pinar on teams regarding access to the SSDs and it is progressing further. Pinar is setting up a shared account for all of us that we can use. However, we should wait for another week until we have access.
