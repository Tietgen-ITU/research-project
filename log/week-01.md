# What have we done this week?
Emil and sat down trying to write down the project description. We tried to follow some of the things that were covered in last weeks presentation. However, while doing so, we got a little bit confused. 

- What is the plan with the research project? Are we going to try and implement fdp support? or is it just to make a plan for how to implement FDP support?
- What is our contribution going to be? Again is it that we are going to write an implementation? or is it to do the feasibility study?
- Are we allowed to get paper about the cachelib library, that does something similar to our project?

Also we talked about you were going to travel, and for that reason we could not have supervision meetings the next two weeks. So our next question is the following:

- We are probably going to send you a draft of the project proposal tomorrow. If you approve that what is the next step? Research question?
- When the research question is done? Do we then try and study how `DuckDB` works?


# Supervision meeting notes
- Maybe we can still get some numerical numbers. But we should not do an extensive performance analysis.
- Our contribution is to make an implementation proposal. 
  - Another goal if things go well, what could we measure, and reason about it.  
- Not necessary to reference meta paper.

- There could be other things when we write to disk that could be interesting. 

**How to write the paper**
- Don't care about the number of pages, more like that we can convey the information good enough
- A plan section can be included to describe next steps. 

**How to structure the Project Proposal**
- Motivation is already written
- write intended learning outcomes
- Todo/tasks about what to do during the project
- Method is experimental

**Pinar travels**
- Create teams channel 
- Meet Monday in september 30th
- And we are maybe going to have supervision next week but decision will be in last minute


# Actions
- Create teams channel
- Invite pinar
- Send project proposal to pinar
  - If approved go through DuckDB to get it to know it.
